Fun project made in secondary school.

This is just Vanilla Python project which can be run with PyGame library of Python.
It is simple chess game with implemented board and all moves with them logics. There are 1 by 1 move system,
but there isn't a validation if there is a check situation or checkmate. Also there is not any AI playing with us, 
just manually 1 by 1 move ourselve. 

I left this project because of time and diffrent priorities.
